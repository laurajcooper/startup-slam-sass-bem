# Styling with SASS and The Basics of BEM

Created for Startup Slam 2020 (Virtual)

The mere thought of writing CSS can send some developers into a panic due to its traditionally tedious and repetitive nature. In this workshop, you’ll learn about the foundations of SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), a CSS extension language that makes writing stylesheets a breeze. SASS allows you to nest styles, create variables & reusable rulesets, and organize your stylesheets into logical smaller segments for readability. You will learn how to use basic compiling software to translate your SASS into basic CSS that the browser can read, and see some examples of more advanced SASS features. You’ll also learn about BEM (Block Element Modifier), a system that uses specially formatted HTML classes to help you further optimize your stylesheets and make the whole process more efficient.

### Requirements:
Basic knowledge of HTML, intermediate knowledge of CSS
